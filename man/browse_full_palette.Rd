\usage{
browse_full_palette(palettes = aop:::aop_palettes)
}
\arguments{
\item{palettes}{A tibble containing palette metadata, typically \code{aop:::aop_palettes}. The tibble must include
a \code{name} column (character) and a \code{hex} column (list of character vectors with hex codes).}
}

or can be embedded in a Quarto/HTML document.
}
\description{
Creates a browsable HTML layout showing all colour palettes in a structured and scrollable format.
Each palette appears in a separate row, with the palette name on the left and its swatches displayed
as rectangular blocks. Each swatch includes the hex code printed below it for easy reference.
}
\details{
This function is useful for previewing all palettes visually, sharing them in documentation, or exporting
them as a browsable HTML page. It is designed to work with the \code{aop_palettes} tibble but can be used with
any compatible tibble of the same structure.
