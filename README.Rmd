## Overview

The `aop` package is the companion to the book *The Anatomy of Plots*. It provides colour palettes and ggplot2 scales used throughout the book to help design visually impactful plots. The package will include more features in the future, such as custom themes and functions to help with plot design and assessing accessibility in a systematic way.

## Installation

You can install the development version of aop from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("ddauber/aop")

# OR

# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("ddauber/aop")
```

## Example

Here's how to apply an Anatomy of Plots palette with ggplot2:

``` r
library(ggplot2)
library(aop)

ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg, colour = factor(cyl))) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  scale_colour_plot(palette = "sunset")
```

It also enables you to browse palettes systematically by - name, - length of colour palettes, - mood (warm, cold, moody, etc.), - mode (light or dark), - tags, etc.:

``` r
library(aop)
browse_palettes(mode = "dark",
                mood = "moody")
```

The `aop` package includes a function to identify the most dinstinct colours in a palette. For example, if you want to use the most distinct colours from the "sunset" palette included in the aop_palette, you can use the `select_distinct_colours()` function:

``` r
library(aop)
select_distinct_colours(aop_palette("sunset"), k = 2)
```

There is also a way to inspect palettes and their distinct colours visually. The aop package defines dinstinct colours as those in the palette that are perceptually most different from each other using the `farver` package to determine colour distances. The `test_palette_selection()` function allows you to visually inspect the distinct colours in a palette and select the number of colours you want to see. For example, to see the two most distinct colours in the "sunset" palette, you can use:

``` r
library(aop)
test_palette_selection(
  "sunset",
  k = 2,
  title = "2 Distinct Colours"
  )
```
